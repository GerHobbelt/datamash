BASH Auto-completion
====================

bash auto-completion script is in ./contrib/bash-completion/datamash .
If ./configure finds the needed bash-completion parameters during setup,
the bash completion script will be automatically installed to the correct
place (e.g. /usr/share/bash-completion/completions or /etc/bash.d).

Script installation can be disabled with:
    ./configure --with-bash-completion-dir=no

Or set to a specific directory with:
    ./configure --with-bash-completion-dir=[PATH]

Note when using `./configure --prefix=DIR`, the bash-completion
default directory can still be outside DIR (e.g `/usr/share/bash-completion`).
To disable or override it, use `--with-bash-completion-dir`.
